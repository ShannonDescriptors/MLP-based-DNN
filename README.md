1. Download or make a clone of the repository
2. Make a new conda environment using the environment file 'mlp_dnn.yml'
3. Run the python files directly using a python IDE or from command line

Note:
1. The function file is KiNet_mlp.py. Therefore, directly run the other python files apart from these.

2. The objectives of the rest of the scripts are as follows: (i) For 2D GNN model, run: 2D_GNN_logp_with_shannon_partial_shannon.py (ii) For 3D GNN model, run: 3D_GNN_logp_with_shannon_partial_shannon.py (iii) For MLP-2D GNN hybrid model, run: 2D_GNN_hybrid_mod_logp_with_MW_with_partial_shannon_in_MLP_-2_-4_layers.py (iv) For MLP-3D GNN hybrid model, run: 3D_GNN_hybrid_mod_logp_with_MW_with_partial_shannon_in_MLP_-2_-4_layers.py
